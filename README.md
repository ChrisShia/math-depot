This is a Go program that provides various mathematical functions such as GCD, HCF, LCM, Mod, NChooseK, sequential multiplication, factorial, and power calculations.
The program handles negative numbers in some cases by considering them as non-negative. However, it doesn't handle all possible edge cases or input validations, so it's important to use it judiciously for the time being.
Let's break down each function:

1. **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)**: This function calculates the GCD of two integers. It uses a simple iterative method where the larger number is reduced by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. This remainder is the GCD of the two numbers.

Example: 
```
GCD(56, 98) 
= 98 - 56 
= 42 
= 42 - 28 
= 14 
= 56 - 42 
= 14 
Therefore, GCD(56, 98) = 14
```

2. **HCF (Highest Common Factor)**: This function is similar to GCD. It returns the largest number that divides both given numbers without leaving a remainder.

Example: 
```
HCF(56, 98) 
= HCF(98 - 56, 56)
= HCF(42, 56)
= HCF(56 - 42, 42) 
= HCF(14, 42) 
= HCF(42 - 2*14, 14) 
= HCF(14, 14) 
Therefore, HCF(56, 98) = 14
```

3. **LCM (Least Common Multiple)**: This function returns the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers. It uses the formula LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b).

Example: 
```
LCM(6, 8) 
= 6*8 / GCD(6, 8)
= 48 / 2
Therefore, LCM(6, 8) = 24
```

4. **Modulus Operation**: This function returns the remainder of division of two numbers.

Example: 
```
Mod(10, 3)
= 10 % 3
= 1
Therefore, Mod(10, 3) = 1
```

5. **NChooseK (Number of Combinations)**: This function returns the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to the order of selection. 

Example: 
```
NChooseK(5, 2)
= 5! / (2! * (5-2)!)
= 5*4*3*2*1 / (2*1 * 3*2*1)
= 10
Therefore, NChooseK(5, 2) = 10
```

The function NChooseK uses different methods to calculate the number of combinations based on the input values. Here's a breakdown of why it uses these methods:

1. nChooseK function:
   This function calls itself recursively when n is less than 21. This is because for smaller values of n, calculating the factorial directly is more efficient due to fewer operations.

2. divisionBySimplification function:
   This function is used when n is greater than 21. It calculates the combination by dividing the product of a sequence of numbers (from n to (n-k)+1) by the factorial of k. This method is more efficient than directly calculating the factorial of both n and k due to potential overflow issues and fewer operations.

3. sequentialMultiplicationFromTo function:
   This function calculates the product of a sequence of numbers from a given start (from) to end (to). It's used in both the nChooseK function and the divisionBySimplification function.

4. factorial function:
   This function calculates the factorial of a given number n by multiplying all integers from 1 to n. It's used in both the divisionBySimplification function and the sequentialMultiplicationFromTo function.

The choice between using nChooseK or divisionBySimplification depends on the values of n and k. If n is less than 21, nChooseK is called to avoid overflow and reduce the number of operations. If n is greater than 21, divisionBySimplification is used to calculate the combination more efficiently.

The decision to use divisionBySimplification when n > 21 is based on the potential for integer overflow when calculating large factorials directly. By dividing the product of a sequence of numbers by the factorial of k, we can avoid this overflow issue and still get the correct result.
